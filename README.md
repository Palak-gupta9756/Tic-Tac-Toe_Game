## 🧩 How It Works

- Players take turns to place `X` and `O`.
- Once a player gets 3 in a row (horizontal, vertical, diagonal), the game:
  - Highlights the winning buttons with red font
  - Draws a red line across the winning path
  - Shows a pop-up message declaring the winner
- If all buttons are filled without a winner, it's a draw.
- A restart button resets the game.
